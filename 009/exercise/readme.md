Implement different Data-Preprocessing techniques, Feature Extraction techniques and different Algorithms 
Solutions needed for
1) Logistic Regression
2) Random Forest Classifier
3) SVM Classifier
4) Decision Tree
5) K-Means
6) Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost)
7) Other
### Suggestions
train/test split ratio is 80/20. But feel free to tweak around it.
Tip: Use Classification models for this dataset, and use .predict_proba() to get the answer in the range 0 to 1

### Note- You can make as many models as you want but only make a PR for any 1-2 of your best models

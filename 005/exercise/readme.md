# Learning Goals

Our goals are to learn:

* Preprocessing of text data and various important processes such as tokenization and stemming
* Regular expressions through stopwords removal from text
* Logistic regression
* Naive bayes
* Application of neural networks on text data
* Vectorization techniques and mathematical implementations through numpy
* Use libraries such as pandas, numpy, nltk, tensorflow, keras and scikit-learn.

# Exercise Statement

In this exercise, one would be able to know how to analyse sentiments of text data using various conventional and advanced algorithms along with textual data processing techniques, such as:

* Logistic reegression for sentiment analysis
* Naive bayes for sentiment analysis
* Word2vec algorithms

# Prerequisites

This exercise goes from basic methods to advanced ones, so there are no hard requisites for this exercise. But it is recommended that one should know basic ML workflow to grasp things conveniently.

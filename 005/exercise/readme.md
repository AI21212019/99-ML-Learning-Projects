# Learning Goals

-> learn preprocessing of text data and various important processes such as tokenization and stemming
-> learn regular expressions through stopwords removal from text
-> learn logistic regression
-> learn naive bayes
-> learn application of neural networks on text data
-> learn vectorization techniques and mathematical implementations through numpy
-> learn and use libraries such as pandas, numpy, nltk, tensorflow, keras and scikit-learn.

# Exercise Statement

-> In this exercise, one would be able to know how to analyse sentiments of text data using various conventional and advanced algorithms along with textual data processing techniques.

-> apply logistic reegression for sentiment analysis
-> apply naive bayes for sentiment analysis
-> apply word2vec algorithms

# Prerequisites

-> This exercise goes from basic methods to advanced ones, so there are no hard requisites for this exercise. But it is recommended that one should know basic ML workflow to grasp things conveniently.
